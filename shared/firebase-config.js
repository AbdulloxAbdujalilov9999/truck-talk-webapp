/* Firebase project configuration.
 *
 * 1. Create a free project at https://console.firebase.google.com
 * 2. Project settings → General → Your apps → add a Web app → copy its
 *    config object and paste the values below.
 * 3. See README.md → "Admin platform setup" for the full walkthrough
 *    (enabling Google/Apple/Email sign-in, creating Firestore, publishing
 *    firestore.rules).
 *
 * These values are not secret — they identify your project, not authorize
 * access to it. Real access control lives in firestore.rules, not here.
